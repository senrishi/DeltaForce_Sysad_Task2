# DeltaForce_Sysad_Task2
**Disclaimer**: This work is quite convoluted, with some of the code being janky and hardcoded solutions. 
The copy_xxxxx.sh scripts are placed to ensure that the first task's scripts are copied over to the host machine and executed properly. There is some hit and miss in terms of directory names in some of the code, this was mostly because I did struggle to keep up with the structure of other scripts, I could have avoided this by making a reference mindmap.
